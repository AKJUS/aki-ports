This is the FreeBSD port of the OpenBSD dhcrelay daemons.

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a standardized
network protocol used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks for dynamically
distributing network configuration parameters, such as IP addresses for
interfaces and services.  The relay allows to forward DHCP requests to
remote DHCP servers which are not found in the same broadcast domain.
